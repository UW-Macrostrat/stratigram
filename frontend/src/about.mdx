**Stratigram** is a tool to capture measured stratigraphy into
a basic database schema that implements emerging community guidelines for
stratigraphic data.

It complements Macrostrat's column editor, which captures the same type of
data but is aimed at supporting _chronostratigraphic_ compilations.
